Certainly! If you already have a Firebase project connected to your mobile app, you can use the same Firebase project for your Windows Forms application. Here are the steps:

1. **Retrieve Firebase Configuration:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Select your existing project.
   - In the Firebase console, navigate to "Project settings" (gear icon) > "General."
   - Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and find the configuration snippet for your mobile app.

2. **Add Firebase SDK to Windows Forms Application:**
   - You can use the Firebase Admin SDK for server-side tasks or the Firebase REST API for direct communication from your Windows Forms application. For simplicity, let's use the Firebase REST API.

3. **Use Firebase Realtime Database in Windows Forms Application:**
   - In your Windows Forms application, use the `HttpClient` to interact with the Firebase Realtime Database.
   - Use the Firebase project configuration (API Key, Database URL) in your requests.

Here's a simple example using C# and `HttpClient`:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        // Replace with your Firebase project configuration
        string apiKey = "your-api-key";
        string databaseUrl = "https://your-firebase-project.firebaseio.com/";

        // Replace with your path in the database
        string path = "your-data-path.json";

        using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
        {
            // Include the API key in the request headers
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", $"Bearer {apiKey}");

            // Send GET request to retrieve data
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync($"{databaseUrl}{path}");

            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                string data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                Console.WriteLine($"Data from Firebase: {data}");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {response.StatusCode}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `"your-api-key"` and `"your-data-path.json"` with your Firebase API key and the path to your data in the Realtime Database, respectively.

Remember to handle security and authentication as needed based on your Firebase Realtime Database rules and the requirements of your Windows Forms application.
